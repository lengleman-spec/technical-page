          JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and widely used programming
          language that enables developers to build interactive and dynamic web
          applications. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to
          JavaScript's syntax, features, and best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript supports a variety of data types that define the kind of
          values you can work with in your programs. The primitive types include
          string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that powers
          dynamic and interactive behavior on the web. As one of the core
          technologies alongside HTML and CSS, it enables developers to create
          responsive user interfaces, validate forms, handle events, and
          communicate with servers. It supports a flexible, dynamic typing
          system and features like first-class functions, objects, and
          synchronous programming with promises and async/await.
        </p>

        <p>
          Java is a robust, object-oriented programming language designed to be
          platform-independent through its "write once, run anywhere"
          philosophy. Compiled into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual
          Machine (JMV), Java is widely used for building large-scale
          applications, Android apps, web servers, and enterprise systems. It
          feautres strong static typing, automatic memory management (garbage
          collection), and a rich standard library, making it a popular choice
          for reliable, maintainable, and portable software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite their similar names, JavaScript and Java are distinct
          programming languages with different purposes and designs. Both a
          high-level, object-oriented languages and share some syntactic
          similarities, such as using braces and similar control structures.
          However, Java is a statistically typed, compiled language typically
          used for large-scale applications, server-side development, and
          Android apps, while JavaScript is dynamically typed and interpreted in
          browsers to create interactive web pages. JavaScript is primarily used
          for client-side scripting on the web but can also run server-side with
          environments like Node.js.

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, "Hello World!" is the simplist program used to
          demonstrate basic syntax. It typically outputs the message "Hello
          World!" to the console using <code>console.log()</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          A variable is a small chunk of computer memory that's set aside for
          holding program data. It's a container that holds a value of some sort
          (like a number, string, object, etc) so that you can use or change it
          later.
        </p>
        <p>Rules for Naming Variables:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1st character must be a letter or underscore (_)</li>
          <li>
            No spaces, punctuation marks, or other special characters other than
            the underscore
          </li>
          <li>Names are case sensitive</li>
          <li>No reserved words</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable in JavaScript, you are simply creating a
          variable and telling JavaScript that a variable exists. You create the
          variable, but you don't give it a value. If you did, it would be
          called <mark><em>initializing</em></mark> a variable. In summary,
          declaration is just reserving a name in memory for a value, and
          initialization is assigning a value to that variable.
        </p>
        <p>In JavaScript, you can declare a variable in one of three ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>var</li>
          <li>let</li>
          <li>const</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The keyword <code>var</code> is an old, outdated way of creating
          variables. It's not used today because it is <em>function scoped</em>,
          meaning a variable declared with <code>var</code> is accessible
          throughout the entire function in which it is declared, regardless of
          block boundries.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>let</code> keyword is used when you think the value of that
          variable might change. It features a <em>block-scope</em> that can be
          reassigned if you want.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>const</code> keyword is used to declare a block-scope
          variable, just as <code>let</code>. The difference is that
          <code>const</code> cannot be reassigned. Once it is assigned, you
          can't change its value. It also must be initalized when you declare
          it. You cannot omit a value with <code>const</code>.
