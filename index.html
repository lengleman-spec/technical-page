          JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and widely used programming
          language that enables developers to build interactive and dynamic web
          applications. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to
          JavaScript's syntax, features, and best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript supports a variety of data types that define the kind of
          values you can work with in your programs. The primitive types include
          string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that powers
          dynamic and interactive behavior on the web. As one of the core
          technologies alongside HTML and CSS, it enables developers to create
          responsive user interfaces, validate forms, handle events, and
          communicate with servers. It supports a flexible, dynamic typing
          system and features like first-class functions, objects, and
          synchronous programming with promises and async/await.
        </p>

        <p>
          Java is a robust, object-oriented programming language designed to be
          platform-independent through its "write once, run anywhere"
          philosophy. Compiled into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual
          Machine (JMV), Java is widely used for building large-scale
          applications, Android apps, web servers, and enterprise systems. It
          feautres strong static typing, automatic memory management (garbage
          collection), and a rich standard library, making it a popular choice
          for reliable, maintainable, and portable software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite their similar names, JavaScript and Java are distinct
          programming languages with different purposes and designs. Both a
          high-level, object-oriented languages and share some syntactic
          similarities, such as using braces and similar control structures.
          However, Java is a statistically typed, compiled language typically
          used for large-scale applications, server-side development, and
          Android apps, while JavaScript is dynamically typed and interpreted in
          browsers to create interactive web pages. JavaScript is primarily used
          for client-side scripting on the web but can also run server-side with
          environments like Node.js.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, "Hello World!" is the simplist program used to
          demonstrate basic syntax. It typically outputs the message "Hello
          World!" to the console using <code>console.log()</code>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          A variable is a small chunk of computer memory that's set aside for
          holding program data. It's a container that holds a value of some sort
          (like a number, string, object, etc) so that you can use or change it
          later.
        </p>
        <p>Rules for Naming Variables:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1st character must be a letter or underscore (_)</li>
          <li>
            No spaces, punctuation marks, or other special characters other than
            the underscore
          </li>
          <li>Names are case sensitive</li>
          <li>No reserved words</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable in JavaScript, you are simply creating a
          variable and telling JavaScript that a variable exists. You create the
          variable, but you don't give it a value. If you did, it would be
          called <mark><em>initializing</em></mark> a variable. In summary,
          declaration is just reserving a name in memory for a value, and
          initialization is assigning a value to that variable.
        </p>
        <p>In JavaScript, you can declare a variable in one of three ways:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>var</li>
          <li>let</li>
          <li>const</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The keyword <code>var</code> is an old, outdated way of creating
          variables. It's not used today because it is <em>function scoped</em>,
          meaning a variable declared with <code>var</code> is accessible
          throughout the entire function in which it is declared, regardless of
          block boundries.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>let</code> keyword is used when you think the value of that
          variable might change. It features a <em>block-scope</em> that can be
          reassigned if you want.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>const</code> keyword is used to declare a block-scope
          variable, just as <code>let</code>. The difference is that
          <code>const</code> cannot be reassigned. Once it is assigned, you
          can't change its value. It also must be initalized when you declare
          it. You cannot omit a value with <code>const</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
        <header>Variable Scope</header>
        <p>
          At it's simplest form, <em>scope</em> is where a variable is
          accessible in your code. There are three basic forms of scope in
          JavaScript.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Global scope</li>
          <li>Function scope</li>
          <li>Block scope</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Global scope variables are declared outside any function or block.
          They're called "global" because you can access them anywhere within
          your code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Function scope variables are declared inside a function using
          <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Block scope variables are declared inside curly brackets { } with
          <code>let</code> or <code>const</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript has two main categories of data types: primitive and
          non-primitive. Primitive data types are simple, single values that are
          <em>immutable</em>, meaning they cannot change their value after it's
          been created. If you attempt to modify an immutable value, a new value
          is created instead of altering the original. Objects are the only
          non-primitive data type, meaning their values can change.
        </p>

        <h2>String</h2>
        <p>
          The string data type is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes
          that is used to represent text in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Must be enclosed in either single or double quotes, or backticks(`).
            Single and double quotes work identically the same, while backticks
            are reserved for <mark>template literals</mark>
          </li>
          <li>
            Must be declared using a variable, and initialized with a string
            value (can have empty string assigned)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Template Literals</h3>
        <p>
          Template literals are a modern and flexible way to work with strings.
          Their defining feature is that they are always enclosed in
          backticks(`), instead of double or single quotes. Template lierals
          allow for string interpolation, which allows you to embed variables or
          expressions directly using ${variable}. They also respect the line
          breaks in the source code, so you can write strings that span multiple
          lines.
        </p>

        <h2>Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal point numbers (aka
          'floating point' numbers). Extremely large numbers can be written with
          scientific (exponential) notation.
        </p>

        <h2>BigInt</h2>
        <p>
          All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating point format.
          BigInt is a datatype that can be used to stroe integer values that are
          too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript number.
        </p>

        <h2>Booleans</h2>
        <p>
          Booleans can only have one of two values: true or false. They are
          often used in conditional testing. The number 0, an empty string ("
          "), null, undefined, and NaN are considered falsy.
        </p>

        <h2>Undefined</h2>
        <p>
          A variable that's undefined is a variable without a value. This data
          type usually signifies an unintentional absence of a value.
        </p>

        <h2>Null</h2>
        <p>
          Null is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of
          any object value. It indicates that a variable or property explicitly
          holds no value.
        </p>

        <h2>Object</h2>
        <p>
          The object data type is the only non-primitive data type, meaning its
          values can change. It is compared by reference, not by individual
          values. By default, variables only contain one data value. Objects are
          variables too, but they can also contain many values all assigned to
          one object.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>

        <p>
          An <code>if...else</code> statement in JavaScript is a control
          structure used to make decisions in code. It allows a program to
          execute one block of code if a specified condition is true, and
          another block if the condition is false. This helps control the
          program's flow based on dynamic conditions. You can also use
          <code>else if</code> to check multiple conditions in sequence.
          <code>if...else</code> is fundamental for building logic in programs,
          such as handling user input, comparing values, or responding to
          different outcomes in a game or application.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few things to keep in mind when using
          <code>if...else</code> statements. First, only the first matching
          condition will run. Also, you can omit the <code>else</code> part if
          you only want to run code when a condition is true.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <p>
          A <code>while</code> statement in JavaScript is a type of loop that
          repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition
          remains true. Before each iteration, the condition is checked - if
          true, the loop runs; if false, the loop stops. This makes
          <code>while</code> loops useful when the number of iterations isn't
          known in advance, such as waiting for user input or processing items
          until a condition changes. To prevent inifinte loops, it's important
          to make sure the condition will eventually become false.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="function_declarations">
        <header>Function Declarations</header>
        <p>
          A function declaration is a way to define a resuable block of code
          that performs a specific task. It starts with the
          <code>function</code> keyword, followed by the function name, a list
          of parameters inside parentheses, and the code block inside curly
          brackets. Function declarations are <mark>hoisted</mark>, meaning they
          can be called before the appear in the code. This makes them useful
          for organizing code and breaking it into manageable, repeatable
          sections.
